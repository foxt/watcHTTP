# watcHTTP
watcHTTP is a watchOS 6 and iOS 12 app to send HTTP requests from your wrist.

## Notice

This code is very messy (and proabaly buggy too!) as it is my first project in Swift that isn't just a Hello World application.

## Thanks

[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for the HTTP library

The HTTP text in the icon is an icon provided by the Material Design project.
